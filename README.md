Transparent coupon fetcher, this extension does not in any way modifies or interacts with the webpages you navigate, it simply works as an automatic interface between the known page simplycodes.com (not affiliated in any way and more coupon pages on the way) and your browsing experience. The focus of this extension is to grow awareness of malicious browser extensions that seek to SCAM content creators out of their affiliated product links.

Right now the extension is under revision by google to go live. I will try to keep updating this extension in my free time. Any ideas are welcomed.

Things to keep in mind: The way I'm fetching coupons at the moment is very limited to basic sites due to the coupons nature.
